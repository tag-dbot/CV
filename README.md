### Highest impact I've had 
[(Full list)](#other-impact-ive-had)
- As a consultant at the largest portuguese eCommerce website (continente.pt, and also wells.pt and zu.pt):

  - Lead developer, maintainer, and responsible for designing new features of the cloud-based Stock Management System, processing and generating over 4 million events daily, without major issues, since 2021.

  - Designed and helped the development of a major migration and replatforming of the legacy cloud-based system responsible for handling customer data, splitting its responsabilities in a new cloud-based microservices architecture, improving resiliency, performance, observability, and cutting operational expenditures by ~40%.

  - Designed and led the development of a major migration and replatforming of the legacy on-prem ETL system responsible for multiple core business flows, including but not limited to: order, payment, and invoice management; to a new on-prem/cloud hybrid microservices messaging based architecture, improving resiliency, performance, observability, and saving on all previous licensing costs (>500k€).

  - Designed and led the development of a major migration and replatforming of the legacy on-prem ETL system responsible for the processing of all product, price, and promotion data, to a new on-prem microservices based architecture improving resiliency, performance, observability, and saving on all previous licensing costs (>800k€).

  - Designed, developed, documented, gave support to, and maintained a logging SDK used internally by multiple teams company-wide to send logs to an internal logging ingestion system, responsible for (at least) 70% (~17 million logs) of all daily logs in the logging system, accelerating the change to the new logging system.

  - Designed, developed, documented, gave support to, and maintained an authentication/authorization SDK used internally by teams to add SAML Authnz flows to internal applications, accelerating the adoption of the new authentication system.

  - Designed a major migration and replatforming of the legacy on-prem image distribution network to a new cloud-based solution, improving performance and simplifying the existing flow.

  - Designed, led the development of, and was effectively the product-owner of an internal Middleware-as-a-Service solution, that acted as a bridge between different services and was responsible for ensuring resilient and scalable communications, by offering strong resilience, scalability, monitoring, and troubleshooting features and guarantees.
    - [More details here](#Middleware-as-a-Service)

  - Led small development teams in multiple smaller projects.

  - Advocated for and helped the improvement of observability, traceability, and logging across multiple teams, by creating code accelerators, guidelines, knowledge sharing and mentoring.

  - Lead developer, maintainer, and responsible for designing new features of the cloud-based Stock Management System, processing and generating >3 million events daily, without major issues, since 2021. 
  - Helped develop and maintain the cloud-based system responsible for handling customer data, including but not limited to: consents, optins, profile, and billing information.
  - Designed and helped the development of a major migration and replatforming of the legacy cloud-based system referenced above, splitting its responsabilities in a new cloud-based microservices architecture, improving resiliency, performance, observability, and cutting operational expenditures by ~40%.

  - Designed and led the development of a major migration and replatforming of a legacy API and ETL flow, responsible for processing, storing, and providing metrics related to customer's purchasing habits.
  - Designed, developed, documented, gave support to, and maintained a logging SDK used internally by multiple teams company-wide to send logs to an internal logging ingestion system, responsible for (at least) 70% (~17 million logs) of all daily logs in the logging system, accelerating the change to the new logging system.

  - Designed and developed a custom watchdog service, installed in our on-prem legacy systems, to collect metrics and data regarding issues like high memory usage, high cpu usage, clock drift, and other specific issues. These metrics and data were then sent to a centralized monitoring platform, to provide a system-wide view of the health of the systems.
    - This service was built on short-notice to act as a stop-gap measure, but ended up being installed in multiple machines and was essencial to monitoring the issue across the entire ecosystem. 
  - Designed a major migration and replatforming of the legacy on-prem image distribution network to a new cloud-based solution, improving performance and simplifying the existing flow.

### Details about some things I've done
#### Middleware-as-a-Service

The Middleware-as-a-Service was built as a replacement for Microsoft Biztalk, and was built to provide the backbone of asynchronous communications, orchestration and business logic that support the core business flows.
It provides high-availability, by supporting multiple instances across multiple machines across multiple datacenters or Cloud Providers, leveraging the native Clustering and High-Availability features from RabbitMQ for the Messaging Layer, and the Competing-Consumers integration pattern to support the Orchestration layer.
It provides "Resilience as a Service", and simplifies integration between different services and platforms, supporting multiple communication protocols like HTTP, gRPC, AMQP and enabling cross-protocol and cross-platform communication.
It enables several messaging and pub-sub integration patterns and scenarios, such as fan-out/fan-in, highly parallel processing via competing consumers, guaranteed delivery, dead-lettering, dynamic and runtime-configurable routing, retry mechanisms for handling flaky systems and communication channels, etc.
This MWaaS was used as an alternative to market solutions, and supported the core asynchronous flows that handle the core business processes like Orders and Payments integration.

Leveraging the high-availability and highly-parallel architecture, this MWaaS enabled us to perform multiple zero-downtime deployments, rollouts/phaseouts, recover from multiple service failures by reprocessing and replaying messages and to have an end-to-end overview of the communication flows between different services via distributed tracing and distributed correlation.
