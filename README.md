### Impact I've had
- As a consultant at the largest portuguese eCommerce website (continente.pt, and also wells.pt and zu.pt):
  - Lead developer, maintainer, and responsible for designing new features of the cloud-based Stock Management System, processing and generating >3 million events daily, without major issues, since 2021. 
  - Helped develop and maintain the cloud-based system responsible for handling customer data, including but not limited to: consents, optins, profile, and billing information.
  - Designed and led the development of a major migration and replatforming of the legacy cloud-based system referenced above, splitting its responsabilities in a new cloud-based microservices based architecture, improving resiliency, performance, observability, and cutting operational expenditures by ~40%.
  - Designed and led the development of a major migration and replatforming of the legacy on-prem ETL system responsible for multiple core business flows, including but not limited to: order, payment, and invoice management; to a new on-prem/cloud hybrid microservices messaging based architecture, improving resiliency, performance, observability, and saving on all previous licensing costs (hundreds of thousands of â‚¬).
  - Designed and led the development of a major migration and replatforming of the legacy on-prem ETL system responsible for all product, price, and promotion data processing, to a new on-prem microservices based architecture.
  - Designed and led the development of a major migration and replatforming of a legacy API and ETL flow, responsible for metrics related to customer's purchasing habits.
  - Designed, developed, documented, gave support to, and maintained a logging SDK used internally by multiple teams company-wide to send logs to an internal logging ingestion system, responsible for (at least) 70% (~17 million logs) of all daily logs in the logging system, accelerating the change to the new logging system.
  - Designed, developed, documented, gave support to, and maintained an authentication/authorization SDK used internally by teams to add SAML Authnz flows to internal applications, accelerating the adoption of the new authentication system.
  - Designed a major migration and replatforming of the legacy on-prem image distribution network to a new cloud-based solution, improving performance and simplifying the existing flow.
  - Led small development teams in multiple projects.
  - Advocated for and helped the improvement of observability, traceability, and logging across multiple teams, by creating code accelerators, guidelines, knowledge sharing and mentoring. 
- At my current employer:
  - Created and led a small CyberSecurity team, creating secure processes and guidelines for the entire company to follow, helping other areas of the company and other developers increase the security and robustness of the developments.
  - Mentored multiple colleagues, helping them grow to a more senior position.
  - Designed an event driven near-real-time cybersecurity vulnerability monitoring and alert system, designed to alert users of new vulnerabilities (registered in cve.mitre, nist, or other sources) that match user-defined filters (affected technology, minimum severity, etc.).
